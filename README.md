## Data Exploration and Analysis

**Data Size:**
This indicates the dimensions of the dataset, where it has 1338 rows and 7 columns.

**Data Types:**
It shows the data types of each column. For example, 'age' and 'children' are represented as integers, while 'sex', 'smoker', and 'region' are represented as objects (likely strings), and 'bmi' and 'charges' are represented as floating-point numbers.

**Total Null Values:**
It states that there are no missing values (null values) in the dataset.

**General Statistics:**

|     |      age |       bmi |   children |      charges |
|:---:| --------:| ---------:| ----------:| -----------:|
| **Count** | 1338 | 1338 | 1338 | 1338 |
| **Mean** | 39.21 | 30.66 | 1.09 | 13270.42 |
| **Std** | 14.05 | 6.10 | 1.21 | 12110.01 |
| **Min** | 18 | 15.96 | 0 | 1121.87 |
| **25%** | 27 | 26.30 | 0 | 4740.29 |
| **50% (Median)** | 39 | 30.40 | 1 | 9382.03 |
| **75%** | 51 | 34.69 | 2 | 16639.91 |
| **Max** | 64 | 53.13 | 5 | 63770.43 |

**Children Value Counts:**
This segment displays the count of each unique value in the 'children' feature. For example, there are 574 individuals with 0 children, 324 with 1 child, 240 with 2 children, 157 with 3 children, 25 with 4 children, and 18 with 5 children.

**Smoker Value Counts:**
It presents the count of 'yes' and 'no' values in the 'smoker' feature. There are 1064 non-smokers and 274 smokers in the dataset.

**Region Value Counts:**
This part shows the distribution of individuals across different regions. The 'southeast' region has 364 individuals, 'southwest' has 325, 'northwest' has 325, and 'northeast' has 324.

Each of these sections provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and statistics, helping us understand the data better.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Examine the distribution of BMI.
   - Investigate the relationship between "smoker" and "charges".
   - Explore the relationship between "smoker" and "region".
   - Analyze the connection between "bmi" and "sex".
   - Identify the "region" with the most "children".
   - Study the relationship between "age" and "bmi".
   - Explore the correlation between "bmi" and "children".
   - Check for outliers in the "bmi" variable.
   - Examine the relationship between "bmi" and "charges".
   - Visualize the relationship between "region", "smoker", and "bmi" using a bar plot.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Perform Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Scale the features using Standard Scaling.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, SVR).
   - Train the models using the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the models using cross-validation.

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Tune the hyperparameters of the selected model using GridSearchCV.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the optimized model using regression metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE).

## General Overview

### About the Dataset

The "insurance.csv" dataset contains information about health insurance costs. It includes various attributes of insured individuals along with their associated healthcare charges. This dataset covers factors such as smoking habits, age, gender, region, BMI (Body Mass Index), and number of children, which can impact health insurance costs.

### Dataset Contents

The dataset typically includes the following columns:

- `age`: Represents the age of the insured individual.
- `sex`: Indicates the gender of the insured individual (female or male).
- `bmi`: Represents the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the insured individual.
- `children`: Indicates the number of children the insured individual has.
- `smoker`: Indicates whether the insured individual is a smoker or not (yes or no).
- `region`: Represents the region where the insured individual resides (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
- `charges`: Represents the healthcare charges of the insured individual.

### Purpose

This dataset can be used to understand and analyze factors influencing health insurance costs. For example, how do insurance costs differ between smokers and non-smokers? What is the impact of age, gender, BMI, etc., on insurance costs? This dataset can help answer such questions and assist in predicting approximate health insurance costs.
